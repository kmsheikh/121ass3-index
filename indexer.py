# create an inverted index for the corpus
# tokens = alphanumeric sequences in the dataset
# stemming = better textual matches
# important text = bolded and heading text should be more important!!
# all words will be indexed, no stop words

# load inverted index hash map from main memory into partial index 3+ times during index construction
# partial indexes will be merged in the end

# inverted index maps token -> postings
# posting = representation of token's occurrence in document (doc id/name + tf-idf score)

# m1 -- use token frequency instead of tf-idf score
